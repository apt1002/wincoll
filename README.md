WinColl is a simple
[Repton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repton_(video_game)) clone, written
in Forth for RISC OS in 1990.

It requires [pForth](https://github.com/rrthomas/pforth) to run. You will
need the latest
[RISC OS version](https://github.com/rrthomas/pforth/releases/tag/riscos).

Once your machine (or emulator) has “seen” the `!pForth` application; that
is, run its `!Boot`, you can start WinColl by double-clicking `!WinColl`.
Note that once you start the game you cannot exit; you will have to reset
your computer (or emulator).

WinColl should run on any version of RISC OS 3, and could probably be made
to run on RISC OS 2 without difficulty.

You can edit the levels with the provided level editor, the BASIC program
`LevelDes` that lives in the `!WinColl` folder.
