WinColl is a simple
[Repton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repton_(video_game)) clone (but
without eggs and monsters), written in Forth for RISC OS in 1989-90.


## Installation and use

* Download and unpack the
  [Zip](https://github.com/rrthomas/wincoll/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) of
  the WinColl Git repository.
* Launch `!WinColl` (for example, by double left-clicking it).

WinColl should run on RISC OS 3.5 to 3.7, and could probably be made to run
on RISC OS 2 without difficulty.

You can edit the levels. Either use [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) and
convert them to WinCollâ€™s plain text format with `tiled2level`, for which
the `pytmx` library is required; or use the BASIC program `LevelDes` that
lives in the `!WinColl` folder. (Shift+Left double-click to open the
folder).
